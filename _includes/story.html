                <h2>The Story</h2>
                <p>LA Lights is no longer. But if you happened to be around the Baton Rouge music scene from 2005 to 2006, you just might have had the chance to jam with us.</p>

                <p>Coming from humble beginnings, the band started as a few friends practicing covers in a hospital supply warehouse. In August of 2005, a relief concert to raise funds for Hurricane Katrina victims nudged the band into their first public performance. The rest is history.</p>

                <p>After a year of playing shows around the gulf south, we had the opportunity to head into the studio and record some of our original songs with local producer, Rhett Mouton. This project became the <i>Break My Fall EP.</i></p>

                <p>Shortly after the release of <i>Break My Fall</i>, the guys decided to go their separate ways. Although short-lived, the legend of LA Lights lives on.</p>
